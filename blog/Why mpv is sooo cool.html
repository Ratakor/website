    Okay so I don't know why some of my friends are still using VLC or
    some crappy video while mpv exists. Mpv is so cool like you can
    remotely play music or video from any site, it takes 0.1s to start
    (I'm looking at you VLC) and another great thing about it is that
    --input-ipc-server option that make it to another level. Integration
    to status bar, launch command like pause, play-next or stop directly
    from dwm or any window manager. At this point it really looks like a
    fancy music daemon that can also play super video. Use mpv, it's the
    best.
