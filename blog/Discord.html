tldr: discord is super bloated and spies on you, but there are good community on it
<br/>
OK so first I use discord only from the browser (Ungoogled Chromium) because
it helps at mitigating all the spyware and it should enhance its performance
BUT discord is sooo bloated, soo full of javascript and malicious stuff that it
still burn my cpu if I start to mess up with some graphic settings. Now the
second part, the spyware issue, I think discord is one of the most harmful
amongst all other spyware software because even privacy focused people are using
it, and also because computer science university tend to only work with discord
(and mail of course :P) because tHaThS wHAt StuDenTs uSE. Well actually that's a
positive/negative point because <i>everyone</i> are on discord so it's pretty
easy to find interesting people, BUT AT WHAT COST.
